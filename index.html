          <p class="lead my-3">
            Have you ever wondered how a website works? The buttons you can
            click and the motions on a website are examples of front-end
            development. The visual appeal of every existing website or
            application you’ve seen has been brought to life by Front-End
            developers. The front-end layer enables you to interact with the web
            and perform desired actions, such as watching videos and shopping
            online, etc. To create the design, feel, and look of the web, three
            fundamental front-end programming languages are used: HyperText
            Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and
            JavaScript.

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Front End Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              Front-end technologies are an essential part of any business that
              strives to enhance user interaction, efficiency, and the look and
              feel of their website or application. Development teams use
              front-end technologies to create a website’s design, structure,
              animation, and everything you see on the screen when you open it.
              A great deal of front-end technology is used because it
              facilitates the work of web coders and designers, increases their
              productivity, and makes the development process quicker, simpler,
              and more effective. Every year, new tools are introduced,
              rendering the old ones obsolete. But, due to the exponential
              growth of front-end technologies over the past few years, it can
              be difficult for developers to keep up with the sheer amount of
              technology at their disposal.

            <h2>Top Front End Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              In the current spectrum of technologies, many frontend
              technologies in web and mobile are certain to shine in 2022. The
              following top 10 front-end technologies are set to dominate the
              market in 2022.
            </p>
            <h3>1. React.js</h3>
            <p>
              ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source
              JavaScript front-end library for creating dynamic and interactive
              applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically, it’s
              responsible only for the view layer. Facebook initially developed
              and maintained the technology, which was then used in some of its
              products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as
              Next.js, React can be utilized for developing single-page, mobile,
              or server-side applications. It allows code to be debugged more
              efficiently by separating it into components. More than 220,000
              websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use
              this platform for their applications/websites include Apple,
              PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Angular.js</h3>
            <p>
              AngularJS is an open-source Javascript front-end framework and is
              an integral part of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular,
              And Node.js). It is mostly used for developing single-page web
              applications (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework, developers
              can create progressive web apps or integrate the framework with
              technologies such as Ionic, Cordova, or NativeScripy to design
              near-native mobile applications. The tool has inbuilt templates
              that make it easy for developers to build UI views quickly.
              AngularJS provides simple, fast data binding without developer
              intervention. By supporting caching, it reduces the CPU’s
              workload. It provides fast loading and less navigation, ensuring
              an effective user experience. Gmail, Forbes, Upwork, Deutsche
              Bank, etc., are some of the popular websites and applications
              built using Angular.js.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Vue.js</h3>
            <p>
              The popular Javascript framework ‘Vue.js’ was created by Evan You
              and used to develop interactive UIs (User Interfaces) (UIs) and
              SPAs (Single-page applications). Vue.js is one of the best
              JavaScript frameworks for creating a lightweight and adaptable
              interactive UI elements. The MVVM model (Model View-View Model)
              architecture pattern and its lightweight nature make Vue.js
              extremely easy to implement. HTML and CSS knowledge is required to
              use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the
              view layer. Frameworks like this can be seamlessly integrated into
              big projects for front-end development without causing any
              problems or issues. 9GAG, GitLab, Nintendo, Behance, and Laravel
              are some of the popular websites and applications built using
              Vue.js.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Flutter</h3>
            <p>
              Developed by Google, Flutter is an open-source, cross-platform UI
              framework that enables the development of flexible and native-like
              apps with the help of a singular codebase. This is one of the
              fastest-growing frontend frameworks for creating flexible and
              effective web designs. Its ability to create native capabilities
              and expressive elements on iOS and Android platforms is a major
              factor driving its popularity. Flutter enables developers to
              create cross-platform apps quickly using the Dart programming
              language and the Skia graphical engine. Flutter – Dart makes it
              easy for developers to create apps fast. The Flutter framework is
              designed primarily for mobile applications running on both Android
              and iOS. A few of the giants that use this platform for their
              applications/websites include Google, Alibaba Group, Dream11, BMW,
              eBay, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>
              Bootstrap is a free, open-source, and powerful front-end framework
              designed to create mobile-friendly, responsive websites and
              applications. Bootstrap includes CSS and JavaScript templates for
              typography, navigation, buttons, forms, and other important UI
              elements/components. This powerful toolkit contains HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript tools to create front-end design elements of responsive
              websites quickly and easily. With its pre-built components, users
              can add themes and icons to their designs. The Bootstrap framework
              was initially developed by Twitter and has become the most popular
              front-end framework available today. Bootstrap is very easy to use
              since developers only need basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge. A
              few of the giants that use this platform for their
              applications/websites include LinkedIn, Postman, Spotify, Twitter,
              Udemy, StackShare, Lyft, etc.
